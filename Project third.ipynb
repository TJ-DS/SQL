    "First two project we learned how to be consumers of data with the SELECT statement. We have done analysis operations that read data and transform it in interesting ways, but none of this physically changes the data in the tables. A SELECT statement is a read-only operation. Sometimes, though, we will want to CREATE new tables, as well as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE records. \n",
